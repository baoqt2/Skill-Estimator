# Skill-Estimator
In this project we are going to use graphical models to do some skill estimation amongst the players and using this model try to predict the outcome of certain matches in the tournament. We will first import data from an actual chess tournament along with the wins and losses for every round (for each player at least out of a maximum 7). Using this data we will train our model using the first few rounds and try to predict the outcome for the remaining.
